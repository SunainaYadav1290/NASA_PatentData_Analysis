## Summary :
In this personal project, I explored a rich dataset of NASA patents, analyzing key
attributes like Application SN, Case Number, Patent Expiration Date, Patent Number, 
Status, and Title. My objective was to investigate trends and patterns that could shed 
light on NASA’s innovation landscape, giving a glimpse into their areas of technological 
advancement. 
Without a specific hypothesis, I conducted an open-ended analysis, aiming to 
extract as much knowledge as possible from the data. This approach enabled me to identify
areas where NASA’s innovations have evolved over time .

1.Collected Patents Data from NASA website using API.
2.Analyzed the different columns in the data . Prepared data for analysis by removing NAN values and duplicate rows.
3.Categorized the different patents into 14 different categories.
4.Plotted a bar chart to find the most common patent categories.
5.Created a Word cloud of the most common words on the Patent_Category column to find the most commonly patented technologies 6.Analyzing NASA Center and their status to understand which centers are producing more successful patents.
