NASA_PatentData_Analysis Project 

In this project, I delved into a rich dataset of NASA patents, examining columns such as Application SN, Case Number, Patent Expiration Date, Patent Number, Status, and Title. My goal was to uncover insightful trends and patterns that can provide a deeper understanding of NASA’s innovation landscape.

•	●	Extracted and analyzed NASA patent data from the NASA API using Python libraries. Predicted the  probability of a patent being approved based on the features of the title using logistic regression.

•	Applied statistical methods to ensure accurate and meaningful insights.

●	Analyzed NASA patent data, revealing that 35.5% of patents are pending issuance.

●	Identified NASA Langley Research Centre as the top contributor, accounting for 30% of total patents.
