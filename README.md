NASA_PatentData_Analysis Project 

In this project, I delved into a rich dataset of NASA patents, examining columns such as Application SN, Case Number, Patent Expiration Date, Patent Number, Status, and Title. My goal was to uncover insightful trends and patterns that can provide a deeper understanding of NASA’s innovation landscape.

•	Extracted patent data from the NASA API and performed in-depth analysis using Python libraries such as pandas,seaborn  and matplotlib. Conducted thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency in the dataset.

•	Applied statistical methods to ensure accurate and meaningful insights.

●	Analyzed NASA patent data, revealing that 35.5% of patents are pending issuance.

●	Identified NASA Langley Research Centre as the top contributor, accounting for 30% of total patents.
